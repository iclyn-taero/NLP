This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\n>organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\n>meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\n>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\n>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n>by Hamilton. \n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\n-- \nDonald R.

Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind\nwork in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a\nwartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.\n \nThe center, which has been shelled several times along with most of\nSarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food\npackages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.\n \nWhile Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here\nsay there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and\ntolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to\ncenturies of Turkish occupation.\n \nSarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman\nCatholic Spain in 1492.

The\nkeys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\nthere I become normal.(...)\n\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off\nsomething.\n\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut\nup' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All\nright, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know\nwhat to say.\n\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\nhad hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\nbeasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\nfelt the whole day very badly.\n\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\nGodlike of sorts.\"\n\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite.

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology.

However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "47", "content": "roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby) writes:\n\n>In article <C5rrot.MMM@rice.edu> fontenot@ravl.rice.edu (Dwayne Jacques Fontenot) writes:\n>>In article <C5rpoJ.IJv@news.udel.edu> roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby) writes:\n>>>In article <1993Apr19.184303.6205@stortek.com> vojak@icebucket.stortek.com (Bill Vojak) writes:\n>>>>\n>>>  [...]\n>>>> 5) Point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the\n>>>>    building, it came as a direct result of the actions of the FBI/BATF.\n>>>>    And the people inside (including 17 children) deserved a trial, instead\n>>>>    of this.\n>>>\n>>>Well they had over 40 days to come out with their hands up on national tv \n>>>to get the trial they deserved.

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.

No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together.

Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do\ninfants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\nIsaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\nof Christ.\"\n\nSo then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\nrespond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\n\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\n\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty\nfor anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\n\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\nRepent and live!\"\n\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\n\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\nnot Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\n\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\nsinned--\"\n\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.\n\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\nwill be made righteous.\"\n\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\nview to see if it doesn't all fit together.\n\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\nconceived me.\"\n\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't\nremember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\n\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\n\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\nis always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible\nagrees with my gut feelings.\n\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\nwrong and choose the right.\"\n\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\nabout Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose\nthe right instead of the wrong.\n\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you\nwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it\nfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange the\ncontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron Cardenas\naaronc@athena.mit.edu\n\n[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of\nyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.\nIt was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one\nform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,\nsaying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is\nan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.\nThe original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists\nstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants\nwithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments\ntend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who\nbaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,\nrather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant\ntheology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to\nchildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate\nthat God accepts even children.  --clh]"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "70", "content": "[Procedural note: Ted directed followups to misc.legal only.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That's really sad if\n> it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever\n> inexplicable reasons.\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n> You'd like Posner, Bill.

But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority\nover the whole \nisland, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. \n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\nUAE has since the \nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\nof a general \nsettlement. \n    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against\nIraq for not fully \nimplementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of\nKuwait. \n    They endorsed once again the \"Damascus Declaration,\" a pact signed\nwith Egypt and \nSyria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove\nIraqi troops out of \nKuwait. \n    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a\nfund they \nannounced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year\nwhich would have \nhelped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. \n    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of\ncontributions from each state \nalthough the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the\n$10 billion agreed \nlast year. \n    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,\nBahrain, Kuwait, Oman and \nQatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although\ntheir unity was only \nmaintained with outside help. \n    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow\nprogress of the \nconservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the\nregion that boasts \nthe bulk of global oil and gas reserves. \n    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. \n    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos\nto create a \n100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member\nagainst external \naggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \n    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man\n\"Peninsula \nShield\" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is\ncommanded by a Saudi \ngeneral. \n    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market\nalthough the summit \ncalled for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due\nto be held in \nSaudi Arabia next December. \n REUTER YA DYA DJG \n\n\n\nRTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT \n\n    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter -

Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on\nSaturday it was ready \nto defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its\neight-year war with \nIraq. \n    \"Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to\nthe world that \nour brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and\nsafeguard the \nterritorial integrity of Iran,\" Iran's Supreme National Security Council\n(SNSC) said. \n    A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council\nvoiced full support \non Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran\nover the Gulf \nislands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. \n    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.\nBesides the UAE, the GCC \nalso groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. \n    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's\nmeeting on \nSaturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:\n\"Iran is surely \nstronger than the likes of you.

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \n    \"If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of\nBahrain should go about \nhis own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which\nbelonged to Iran until \n1970, should be re-established,\" the paper said. \n    \"It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of\nIran's sovereignty \nover Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the\nseparation of Bahrain \nfrom Iran,\" it added. \n    The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,\na year before the \nisland became an independent state. \n    Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully\navoided raising the \nBahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during\nperiods of \ntension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf. \n    Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of\nappeasing pro-Western \nGulf Arab rulers had backfired. \n    \"No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of\nthe Persian Gulf, it \nis the United States and the West which speak the last word,\" it said. \n    \"They (the sheikhs) are nobody,\" Salam said, adding that Iran should\nrevise its policy \ntowards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq. \n    \"Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with\nIraq...and going along with \nsome Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role\nin the formation of \nthe current situation,\" the paper said. \n    Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,\nimproved briefly \nafter Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. \n    But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the\nensuing war, \nagain called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed\na Shi'ite Moslem \nrevolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait. \n REUTER SIJ MZ AET"}, {"Newsgroup": "soc.religion.christian", "document_id": "79", "content": "Have I not commanded you?

The following are quotes of his speech: \n\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \nof Kuwait.'' \n\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \nafter Kuwait itself.'' \n\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's \nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' \n\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \n\n\nOrigins of Kuwait \n\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means \nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \nestablishment. \n\nThe 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait \nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. \n\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart \nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \n1750-1800. pub.1965. \n\nAl-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well \ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the \nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy \nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \nGulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) \n\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \ntried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \nGulf area. \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait \n\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \n\nAbdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \n\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \nwar against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \nthose who had signed it. \n\n\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \n\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \nUniversity, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \n\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \n\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on \nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \nterritory. \n\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \nfather's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \nentitled to receive. \n\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \nhim the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's \ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.'' \n\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \nexplained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman \nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been \nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' \nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' \nThis description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain \ndegree it was run according to protocol. \n\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' \nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \nCazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \narmy.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \n\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but \nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \n\nAfter Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \nTherefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any \nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \n\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the \nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \nsought refuge in Kuwait. \n\nProtection of refugees seeking political \nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence \nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \nneighbors. \n\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \n\nAs to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale\nthat was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was\nprivate and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and\nI enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will\nnever attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently\nabout having to help pay for it.)\n\nHowever, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to\ngive government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,\nwe have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely\nbecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other\nissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the\nsidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just\nwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech\nshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can\nimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority\non a case-by-case basis.\n\nNot so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly\nwhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.\n\nJust as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a\ncase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nThere is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with\nfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a\ngovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an \"efficient\"\nmanner; I call it political market failure.\n\nThus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to\nswallow the \"whole libertarian agenda.\"\n\nRoger Collins"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.mideast", "document_id": "95", "content": "cpr@igc.apc.org (Center for Policy Research) writes:\n\n# 3.

The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was \ncrushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, \nwould look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV \nnews.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.\nPropane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent \nwith what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...\n\n: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying\n: to get out of the compound?\n\nRemember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.\nConflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being\nworn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those\non the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they\nthought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to\nput it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and \nconcussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable\nof moving.\n\n: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.\n\nGood question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the \nthings that the FBI said (\"The BD's started the fire.\"  \"The BD's bodies\nwere found with gunshot wounds.\") that are now being refuted by the \nevidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making\nstatements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make\nthem sound like fact.  \n\n: I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe\n: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the\n: contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under\n: the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still\n: prefer to believe the cultists?\n\nYes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop\nstring of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations\non numerous occasions.\n\nAnd as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until\nthey were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If\nthe BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be\ndead today?  \n\n: (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)\n\n: >But then\n: >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that\n: >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.\n\n: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?\n\nYes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now\nif we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of\napologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected\naccountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would\nhappen as often as they do.\n\n: So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty\n: people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up\n: one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States\n: to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.\n\nAcutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of\nthis sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  \nOddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after\nthe initial raid on the BD's.  \"Coincidence?  I think not!\"\n\nAnd as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over\nwalls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince\nthe world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by\nthe investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to \na gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the\nbuilding.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to \ncover its ass.  \n\n: And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he\n: on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be\n: investigated. You first.\n\nOh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.

However, as only some are saved - and those who are\nsaved are saved by the grace of God, \"not by works, lest any man should\nboast\" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to\nheed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and\nchosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not\npredestined, but reprobated instead.\n\n>so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed\n>and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved,\n>and nothing in between.  hmmmm.\n\nCertainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could\nhave their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing\nGod to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided\ninto those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the\nroad to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus,\nno one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect\nand predestined.

Anyway, why would you want something in\nthe hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to\nlay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said.\nThis is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who\nare rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them\ntheir blessing know, as they have chosen.

Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it\nin Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with\npoorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved\nthrough fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for\nwhatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).

The world now has almost 10\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\n  dramatically.\n\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\n  of Seven nations.\n\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\n  overall U.S. economy.\n\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\n\n    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\n  reduce demand.\n\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\n  at the expense of the individual.\n\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nAvailable from:\n  Cato Institute\n  224 Second Street SE\n  Washington, DC  20003\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                        The Cato Institute\n\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\n    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\n  of the American Revolution.\n    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\n  civil liberties.\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\n  no government funding.

Thanks to all of you that\nreplied.\n\n\n> 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.\n\na) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB\n   and EISA version should have no problems.\n \nb) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't\n   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way\n   of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,\n   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages\n   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this\n   problem.\n\nc) FALSE\n\nd) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M\n   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.\n\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\n\n\n> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches\n>    set but it is much slower.\n\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \n \nb) Dunno.\n\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\n\n\n> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.\n\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\n   non-interlaced.\n\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\n\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\n\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\n\n\n> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many\n>    cases.\n\na) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\n   to software incompatibility.\n\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\n\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\n\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\n\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\n   the old driver.\n\n\n> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.\n\na) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\n \nb) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\n   every 20 minutes or so...\n\nc) Depends on many many things.\n\n\n> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)\n\na) I like it.\n\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\n\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\n\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\n\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat is the end of the questions.

It is\npossible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew\nBible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the\nsame problem with direct quotes.)\n\nAgain, Matthew 1:5 (\"Boaz begat Obed of Ruth\") tells us that Matthew\nknew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz\nand  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in\nthe OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was\nfamiliar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important\nenough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.\n\nReferences like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his\nOT source inspired or inerrant or canonical.

Sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the\nconcept."}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "151", "content": "Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\n\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\n-- \n\t\t\t\t\t-- Don Porges\n\t\t\t\t\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\n\t\t\t\t\t..uunet!inmet!porges"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "152", "content": "good job to whoever posted the article.

Why must there be a \"why\" to the universe?\"\n[remainder of message deleted]\n\nPardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)\n\nThe reason we can say \"God just exists\" and can't say \"The universe just \nexists\" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural \nlaws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be \nits own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.\n\nGod, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject \nto such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, \nGod's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence \nof a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the \nsupernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused \nphenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the \nsupernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very \nnature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.\n\nThis is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted \nto clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the \nnatural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being \ninterchangeable.\n\n- Mark"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "155", "content": "In <1993Apr15.143320.8618@desire.wright.edu>, demon@desire.wright.edu sez:\n>\tA judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two\n>new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the\n>impact, not from the fire.\n>\n>\tThoughts?\n>\n>\tIt's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start\n>denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led\n>to the previous ruling appear.\n\nThere's this minor thing called \"interest of finality/repose\".

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Okay, today's schedule.  As you know, the \nPresident jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.  \n\t     \n\t     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the \nRose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., \nhe will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 \np.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo \nop at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.\n\t     \n\t     Any questions?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he moving towards some major decision this week \non Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss \nhis options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy \nadvisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  \nHe'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll \ncontinue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but \nobviously the situation there is very serious.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly \nexcept on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 \np.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it \nyesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Before anything had happened.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since something has happened he's had nothing to \nsay.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  \nAnd we'll have more to say about it later today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In what forum is that going to be?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He will talk about Waco at that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that something we can take live?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a \nlittle later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I \ndon't know if it's something you'd want to take live.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as \nwell?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \nAttorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \nanyone else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he didn't talk yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the reaction to her resignation statement \nthat she made last night?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \nAttorney General Reno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \nwhat actually happened?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \n\t     \n\t     This was a very difficult situation and all the \ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?  They have to --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \nit's not useful.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \nof what happened and whether --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \nlater, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He will order an investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \nsay about an investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \nplanning and so forth?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \naspects he was involved with.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \ntoday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \nthat she'll be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \n\f\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \nthe tragedy of the outcome.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \nthing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \nanybody at the White House.  So who --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\nstaff level.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \ntalked -- he may have at one point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And was the White House role just to seek \ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \ninformation campaign that followed?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \nstatement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \nher personally yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \nspoken this morning.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \nout to dry all day yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \n1,000 percent.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \nthe phone and tell her.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \nthis morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why can't we find out?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \nright now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \nis pick up the phone.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Does okay mean --\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \nadministration?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \ncongressional investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \nincidents that occurred yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \nWhat do you know about those two --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \npeople who came out of the compound.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President received any report today in \nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \nthe so-called experts?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \nsupports that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on \nthe ground?  Does he back those --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \nmade.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \ndecision?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \nfor it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \nand the Director.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \nthis --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \nspeak to Clinton?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \non the situation in Waco?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \ndaily basis.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who briefed the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Another subject?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On another subject.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \ntreaty?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \nyet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On or off campus?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this at a location outside the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \ndon't know exactly where yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a question they're going to try to be \ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \nPowell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \nthe no-fly zone?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

I'll get back to you on that.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  As a group, or one by one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \nstate that are here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \ndetails of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not a live phone hook-up?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \nit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what it's on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \nHouse?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Drug czar?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect it before the march?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \nwe end up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word \nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \nJanet Reno?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's become a pressing question for the last \nseveral hours.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \nwill be at the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it \nsounds like?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \nup, but it was about economic issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \ntarget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \nspeech at the end of May --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.\n\n                                 END10:08 A.M. EDT"}, {"Newsgroup": "rec.motorcycles", "document_id": "169", "content": "Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "170", "content": "Chemical weapons are not concidered a *very* effectiv weapon against\nmillitary forces.

She said\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\nchange...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )\nand more....\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\ncounsel.\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\nwith whom we come in contact.\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\npeople. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\na friend is in error, but you don't want to \"cause trouble\".\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are\nwe are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a\nfervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.\nIn more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's\nkeeper.\n\nIn Jesus and Mary,\nElizabeth"}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "180", "content": "I am getting desperate.

That doesn't mean that the\nsame people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether\nthe relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to\nrepresent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least\n*partly* an empirical question.  \n\nIn some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because\nover time they always seem to lead to trouble.

But in\npractice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion\nthat nobody can really have that degree of control over another and\nnot abuse it.  \n\nThe message you were responding to was asking you to look at the\nresults from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note:\nChristian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some\nextremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely\non that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least\nrelevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't\nlook at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such\nassociation.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at\nit too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such\nexaminations would necessarily come out the same way.

How come if they\nwere under Satan, they could have such personalities. \n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam.\nBut I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of\njudgement.\n\t\n\tNow I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and \nits teaching. \n\nIMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.\n\t    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.\n\nP.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,\n     and bit.listserv.catholic.\n\n\nIn Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........\n\t\t\t\t\t       Jesus loves you.......\n\tTabut Torsina\n\tTORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU\t   \n\n[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a\ndiscussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\nIndeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\nare saved is at the heart of it.\n\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\nIf this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\nrelevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\n\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\nChristianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\nways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\n\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\nWhat I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\nGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow\nanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they\nfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at\nwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive\nalternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis\nfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.\n\n--clh]"}, {"Newsgroup": "rec.motorcycles", "document_id": "203", "content": "Is there a way to wax out a dull finish (minor scrathes)?

On a couple of occasions on\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\nreconquer them today.\n\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\nthe Muslims.\"\n\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\ncalls for strong action.\n\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\n\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\nBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to\nthe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by\ngetting involved there.\n\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\nso far been the same.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\ninvestigation.\n\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\n\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\n\nTypical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\n\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\n\n***\n\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\n\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\nbeen a year ago.\"\n\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\nnot city people.\n\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\n\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\n\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\n\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\nidea.\n\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\nrespect for Clinton's presidency \"depend...on his acting\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely\na betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\n\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\n\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.\n\nSincerely, Ronald Bleier"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "210", "content": "/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / hays@ssd.intel.com (Kirk Hays) /\n   3:31 pm  Apr 13, 1993 / \n\n   >Some of the pro-gun posters in this group own no guns.

First \nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \nsectors a week.\n \n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \nsectors for a brief period of time.\n \n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\n \n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\n \n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \nmy hard drive?

Is\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\nmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.\n\n>\"`You've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's  \n>not as obvious.

However, this does not refute debunking\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\n\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.

A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  \n>a month.  \n\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\nbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\ncovered for basic care.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn't even consider a \"voucher\" approach\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\n\n>******************************************************************  \n>\n>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \n>ACHE AND PAIN?  \n>\n>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \n>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \n>bills.  \n>\n>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  \n>per-person health bill than we do.\n\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\nnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\n\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer \n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \n1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n>ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \n>\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \n>\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \n>national plan.

You can opt out in Canada\nand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\n\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\nthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's\npublic health insurance plan.\n\ngld\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGary L.

Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.

Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the\nOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by\nthe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:\n\n\"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to\na combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.\n\n    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's\nstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with\nthe word \"undertiding\" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement\nof his Position Statement.

Their neighbours thought they were a little\nstrange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live\nnext door to.\n\nOne version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out\nof a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If\nthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know\nthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof\nthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend\nthemselves.\n\n: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me\n: they *realy* belong in society ...\n\nIf you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it\nis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The\npeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started by\nthe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is\nclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.\n\n'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but\nI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say\nabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.\n\nSome more interesting facts about the Waco incident:\n\n1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing\n    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?\n\nAll in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be\ntaken with a grain or two of salt.\n\nRob.\n--\nRobert A.

People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when\nI was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just\ntalking through somebody else?\" (paraphrased).\n\nWith all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that\nwe would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are \n'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.\n\nThese signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God?\nThat these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking\n  they are evil?\nWell, is faith in God evil?\nIs true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil? \nWhy can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His\n  generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to\n  Him for salvation?\nWhy are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are\n  in Christ?\nWhat brings us these:\n    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?\n        which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?\n    fears of being humbled?\n    fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)?\nWhy can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the\n  sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us\n  by martyrs and saints?\nWe'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's\n  opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,\n  instead of having communion in one body with Christ.\nWhat makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can\n  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages?\nWhy is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster?\nWhat prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love\n  to others who are not?\n\nWhy are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope\n  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His \n  acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) \n  everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these\n  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?\n\nWhy then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:\n  \"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that\n  with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\"\nbut then she continues:\n  \"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you\n  have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\"\nWhy hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:\n  \"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life\n  as what the Gospel brings.\"?\nWhy not do so?  How?  To the world?\nTo this, the Mother says:\n  \"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\"\nWhy worry if it is going to be of good use to many?\nOur Holy Mother says:\n  \"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or \n  anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\"\n\nAlthough the Holy Mother does not insist because:\n  \"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\"\nbut she follows this with:\n  \"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how\n  you have lived this day.\"\nWhy does she constantly conveys:\n  \"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself\n  in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\" or one time when we \n  decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc.\nThe Holy Mother warns:\n  \"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from\n  my peace plan and prayer.\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman\n  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep\n  God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)\n\nDo you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and\n  our motherly protector from the anti-Christ?\nThe one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils\n  that the serpent brings upon us? \nThis obedient and blessed new Eve?\nThe mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan?\nHaven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever\n  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her\n  in good purpose?\nWhy do we choose to be blind?\nWhy fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's\n  ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother?\nThe mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient\n  harm and example done by the ancient Eve.\nShe has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.\nThe new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the \n  righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride.\nShouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the\n  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear\n  the Son of God in her womb?\nWhy fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary\n  faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock\n  (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more \n  righteous members for her Son's coming.\nNot all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy\n  of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,\n  approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and\n  divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the\n  Scripture.\n  \n\nAlso, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:\n  \"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear\n  God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\" \n\nShe encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant \nfaith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, \nbut with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and\nacknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.\n\nLet's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life\nthat God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when\nit will be late.\n                                                      \nNowadays, Mary says, \n\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\"\nHave peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to\nothers.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\"\n                                                                       \n\nAnd you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's\nour good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to\nshare God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.\n\nWith Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.\n\n-----\nNote:  All enclosed in quotes are from \"Latest News of Medjugorje\"\n       Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

In addition to our friendship, you would also\nhave the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis.\nIn exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner\nand an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to\ncough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or\nsomething.\n\nAlso, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be\ngreatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nScott Brandt"}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "257", "content": "In <1993Apr26.172936.908@eurom.rhein-main.de> hein@eurom.rhein-main.de (Hein Roehrig) writes:\n\n> \n>I am not sure whether I am here in the right area, but does \n>anybody here know whether Windows NT does/will include a X \n>Windows server so that it can run X Window applications \n>remotely? \n\nNo, it does not.\n\n-- \n\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world.\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me."}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "258", "content": "Hi,\n\n  I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+.

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...\n----------------"}, {"Newsgroup": "soc.religion.christian", "document_id": "260", "content": "[Several people were involved in trying to figure out who first used\nthe phrase \"God-shaped hole\".  --clh]\n\n\"There is a God shaped vacuum in all of us\" (or something to that effect) is\ngenerally attributed to Blaise Pascal.\nWhat I want to know is how can you have a God shaped vacuum inside of you if\nGod is in fact infinite (or omnipresent)?\n\n=========================================================================\n||     Name: Andrew James Fraser  E-mail: fraseraj@dcs.gla.ac.uk       ||\n||     ESE-3H student, University of Glasgow.\t\t\t       ||\n||     Standard disclaimers...                                         ||\n\n[Don't you think you're being a tad too literal with this metaphor?  --clh]"}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "261", "content": "servis@author.ecn.purdue.edu (Brian K Servis) writes:\nThat's me....\n>I just downloaded the Windows Ghostscript package(gswin252.zip,gs252ini.zip) \n>from ftp.

This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\nwill go to hell.\n\nIt's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take a\nmore complete look at scripture.\n\nColossians 2:11-12 \"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\npower of God, who raised him from the dead.\"\n\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do\ninfants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\nIsaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\nof Christ.\"\n\nSo then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\nrespond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\n\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\n\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty\nfor anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\n\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\nRepent and live!\"\n\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\n\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\nnot Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\n\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\nsinned--\"\n\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.\n\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\nwill be made righteous.\"\n\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\nview to see if it doesn't all fit together.\n\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\nconceived me.\"\n\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't\nremember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\n\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\n\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\nis always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible\nagrees with my gut feelings.\n\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\nwrong and choose the right.\"\n\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\nabout Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose\nthe right instead of the wrong.\n\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you\nwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it\nfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange the\ncontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron Cardenas\naaronc@athena.mit.edu\n\n[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of\nyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.\nIt was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one\nform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,\nsaying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is\nan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.\nThe original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists\nstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants\nwithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments\ntend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who\nbaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,\nrather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant\ntheology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to\nchildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate\nthat God accepts even children.  --clh]"}, {"Newsgroup": "soc.religion.christian", "document_id": "264", "content": "Hi!\n\n\tAnyone know anything about the Interdisciplinary Bible Research\nInstitute, operating out of Hatfield, Pa?\n\n\tI'm really interested in their theories on old-earth\n(as opposed to young earth) and what they believe about evolution.\n\n\tThanks,\n\t\tIn the Master,\n\n\t\tCharley.\n\n\n--\n       Seek God and you will find, among other things,\n                          piercing pleasure.\n       \n       Seek pleasure and you will find boredom, disillusionment        \n                      and enslavement.\n       \n                               John White (Eros Defiled).\t\n\n[Note that I do not accept discussions of evolution here, as there\nis a dedicated group for that, talk.origins.  --clh]"}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "265", "content": "****************************************************************************\n\nBorland provides a database lib called Paradox Engine which can access\nand use the database files aswell as many other things.\n\nGary.\n\n-- \n``````````` bell@nellads.cc.monash.edu.au `````````````````````````````````````\n| Gary Bell                                                                   |\n| Department of Robotics and Digital Technology                               |\n|Faculty of Computing, Caulfield Campus, Monash University, Australia         |\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nParadox Engine is the library  for Paradox .\n\n\nArtur Babecki\nartur@ii.uj.edu.pl\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nBorland sells the Paradox Engine -- which has all the Paradox calls in it.\nIts hardly SQL though.

So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "286", "content": "Anybody for carpeting in Bosnia/Serbia?

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true \nmulti-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 \nprograms as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is\nprimarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be\neconomical for most users.\n\tSpeaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  \nIt iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's \njust to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, \nand it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed \non CD-ROM.\n\nChicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue \nmultitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, \nand does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably \nbe more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the \nmain ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.\n\tThe Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense \ncompetition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will \narise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the \nclient machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, \npartly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  \n(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't\nscorn the concept.)\n\tAnyway, don't expect it soon.

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \nmathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't \nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \nno exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is \nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \nteachers.\"\n\nNow, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\nVenus and back.\n\n\t\t\tOne for the \"road\"\n\n\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \n\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with \n\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \n\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\n\n\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History \n\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \n\tthe Royal Astronomer.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\n\nThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\n\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\n\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \nproblem book.\n\n\t\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\n\n\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \n\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \n\tit the mother of all wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Anania of Shirak\n\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \nMovses of Khoren).\n\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\n\n\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\n\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \n\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \n\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\n\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \n\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \n\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \n\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \n\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\n\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\n\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\n\n\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \n\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \n\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \n\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \n\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \n\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \n\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\n\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \n\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \n\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\n\n\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \n\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \n\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \n\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \n\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \n\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \n\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \n\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\n\tat the king's court began to envy me.\n\n\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \n\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \n\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \n\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \n\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \n\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\n\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \n\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \n\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \n\toriginally.\n\n\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \n\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \n\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \n\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \n\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \n\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \n\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \n\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \n\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \n\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \n\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \n\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \n\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \n\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\n\n\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \n\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \n\tassume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \n\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\n\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \n\twith him.\n\n\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \n\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \n\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's \n\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \n\tfor my efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\tProblems and Solutions\n\n\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\n\ton verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \n\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \n\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \n\tcopies were printed in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\n\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\nmanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to \nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\" Biding\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\n\nIn the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\n\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \nfull glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.\n\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \n572.\n\nProblem 1\n\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\n\nProblem 8\n\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\n\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \naccording to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \nAnania's Problems and Solutions.\n\nProblem 18\n\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\n\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \nAnania's time -- for instance, problem 7.\n\nProblem 7\n\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\n\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself\nand offer you just one more.\n\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\n\nProblem 20\n\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\n\n\t\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\n\n\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \n\tbibliography.\n\t\t\t\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\n\t\t\t\t\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\n\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \nof Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\n\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\n\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \nprinter's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\nof Russian academic typography.\n\n\t\t\tBack to Earth\n\n\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \n\tworks in this domain.

The question, really, has to do with the\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\n\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\namong the Greeks.\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\n\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.

He doesn't control our every thought or action,\nbut takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns\nit into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts with\nthe belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine,\nit is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were to\nexert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be \nimpeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe that\nGod did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort\nof conditional free will.

I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this could\nbe seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't\nsee it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad into\nsomething good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over\nanother.

We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly\narrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to\nparticipate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We\nhave arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed\nus the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other\nnations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have\nstricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the\nhonor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public\nas our sins have been.\n\nWhen Jesus said \"Judge not that ye be not judged\", he was not addressing\nthose like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to\nrepent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down\ncondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove\nthe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But\nHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command\ntoo.\n\nOur problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were\nrebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the\nexcuse that we don't want to judge anyone.\n\nIn truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more\nand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin\nwhat it is and do so openly.

This\n>also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\n>David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\n>well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER.\n\nThe argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\nMatthew\". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\nline of descent from David, the king.\n\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)"}, {"Newsgroup": "rec.motorcycles", "document_id": "366", "content": "Hi.

Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\nof Judaism\".\n\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\noutside Israel \"who were using other people's countries like\nhotels\".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\ncharacter\".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "388", "content": ">>papresco@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca (Paul Prescod) said:\n>>\n>>> Sorry.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\nBooks, Inc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\nDC  20006.\n\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America's visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"\n\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,\nand may God bless each and every one of you.\u001a"}, {"Newsgroup": "soc.religion.christian", "document_id": "437", "content": "I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and\nministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event.\n(About 40 years or so).

They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.

PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.\n\n                               END10:25 A.M.

The user site can enter their\nsite-specific \"batch profile\" into a dataset within our product, specifying\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\ninteractive session.\n\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\n\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\nSince my first posting I've learned that there are several third party\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\nAnd I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\nscript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\n\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like \"Is vi\navailable for Windows?\") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\n\nOne last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.mideast", "document_id": "448", "content": "backon@vms.huji.ac.il writes:\n: In article <1pll52$sms@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>, cl056@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Hamaza H.

See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.

I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.

I'll leave it unnamed\nsince I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\nto hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\ncannot be a good way to build love.\n\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \nneighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \nwith theirs.

A\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\nACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\n\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school's position\nsomewhat disheartening.\n\nI understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\nturn into no position at all?\n\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\n\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\nnear the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What's going on?\" He says, \n\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're \nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\n\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were \nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\nwere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice \nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and \nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\n\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was \nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \nmicrodistrict.\n\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\n\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We're in School No. 33, we need to be \nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\"\n\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\n\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \nout, we're here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that \nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That's what he did. He went down \nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\n\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\n\nIn the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, \nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\n\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \nthem.\n\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \nget the things any cheaper.\n\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \nfeelings, of course.\n\n   April 8, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

P. A1.\n \n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\n 12,000 people.\n \n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\n \n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\n any laws.\n \n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\n Angeles and San Francisco.\n \n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\n \n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\n is based in South Africa.\n \n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\n \n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\n the search warrant.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\n be reached for comment, his office said.\n \n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\n \n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\n conducted without a warrant.\n \n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\n record speaks for itself.\"\n \n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\n Patterson.\n \n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n under surveillance.\n \n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\n \"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\n say, 'Pinko.'\"\n \n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\n \n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\n photographs.\n \n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\n \n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\n nature of the spy operation.\n \n The file notes that Kraft's articles \"appear frequently in The Times\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\n information.\n \n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\n \n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\n \n \n \n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\n \n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\n police information on citizens and groups.\n \n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\n violations and conspiracy.\n \n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\n spectrum.\n \n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\n files on political figures.\n \n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\n deciding what charges to file.\n \n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\n years.\"\n \n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\n information illegally, he said.\n \n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\"\n \n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\n \n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\n \n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\n \n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\n \n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\n the district attorney said.\n --\n Yigal Arens\n USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\n arens@isi.edu\njs"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.mideast", "document_id": "493", "content": "Zionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.\n\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\nbe it."}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "494", "content": "Wow, I hadn't realized how VENOMOUS this was getting!

Or are you ever so gently suggesting that\n  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn't be allowed\n  to control traffic across its borders?\n\n# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n\n  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles\n  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment\n  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance\" could\n  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to\n  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,\n  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.\n\n  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the\n  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter\n  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?\n\n------------\n\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\n(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  A\ndifficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything\ngood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit\nthe facts into the theory.\n\n\n--- D. C.

If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\n>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.

I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n>\tThe only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  \n>\tyesterday, those people would be alive today.\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.

From a network administrator's implementation,\nhe/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\nThen install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network\nto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers\nare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\n \nAdvantages:\n- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to\n  the local access of main Windows files.\n- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point\n  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing\n  and reduce the cost of down-time.\n- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard\n  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network\n  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster\n  access than local ones.\n- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about\n  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the\n  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk\n  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can\n  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\n- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to\nadminister.\n  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of\n  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\n- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system\n  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for\n  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\n- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup\n  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\n  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be\n  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable\n  applications and *not* user data.\n \nThe SHARED Windows Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure\ndescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of\nfiles to individual \"user\" directories.  These directories may be on a\nlocal hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory.  The bulk of the\nWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory\n(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout\ntheir Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files\nthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include\ngroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\n \nAdvantages:\n- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As\n  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this\n  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\n- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,\n  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct\n  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\n- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files\n  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with\n  all driver updates.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network\n  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the\n  speed of Windows.\n- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's\n  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs\n  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will\n  usually not be able to save their work.\n- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files\n  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a\n  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows\n  files alone.\n- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation\n  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being\n  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\n  \nThe Discussion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows\nuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have\nsetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and\napplication files are on the network with little or no utilization of\nlocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the\ncompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations\nand thus save that much more money.\n \nI would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should\napps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how\nWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy\nbackup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\";\nif the network crashes, work comes to a halt.\n \nNow I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own\nideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to\nhear from people with \"actual\" working experience with users and network\nadministration."}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.guns", "document_id": "534", "content": "The explanations of Federal law enforcement officials about what\nhappened in Waco is just another example of the survivors writing the\nhistory books to put themselves in the best of a bad light.\n-- \nDave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>\n\nI'm beginning to look forward to reaching the %100 allocation of taxes\nto pay for the interest on the national debt.

In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \nhardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \npast and present. \n\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \nto God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \ntechnology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  \nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \nMig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \npilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  \neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\n\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.\n\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\n\n1. The Second World War\n\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\n\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \n\t\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n2. Korean war\n\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\n\t  communism vs. capitalism.\n\t- Probably not justifiable.\n\n3. Vietnam\n\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\n\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\n\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\n\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\n\t- Other factors such as genocide.\n\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\n\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\n\t- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'\n\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\n\t- Probably justifiable\n\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \nor Israel.\n\t- My feelings in this are simple\n\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\n\t- I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear\n\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\n\t- Never justifiable.\n\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I  \n*don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n==========================================================================\n                                    |\nAlastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347\nChief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529\nThe Black Albatross Porject,        |\nUniversity of Otago,                |\nDepartment of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz\nP.O.

It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n>but i digress...

However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.

If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?

Now the\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\nsinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as\nwould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"\n\nAndy Byler"}, {"Newsgroup": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "document_id": "564", "content": "Mornin' all.

As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n\t\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460.\n\n--- 30 ---"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.mideast", "document_id": "570", "content": ">Subject: Unconventional peace proposal\n>\n>\n>A unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.\n>---------------------------------------------------------- by\n>\t\t\t  Elias Davidsson\n>\n\n>Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\n>\n>1.

The\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\non trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\nthe first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\n\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \nNothing had changed.\n\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\n\n. . .\n\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\ntortured in the course of interrogation.

If there are more guns in circulation, if follows\nthat more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to\nthe person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they\nhave to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.  \n\nThe gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.

The work around when\nequations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one\npreceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where\nplaced w/no text wrap around).

In the past, God gave us the ability to create\nlife through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life\nthrough in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely \ncosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to\napproach the glory of God.\n  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we\nwill use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality\nunwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!\n  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't\nimpinging on God's power.

These people -- and those associated with them\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\n    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not\n    have this blessing.\n\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\n    before then.\n\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\n\n-- \nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

He was\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife\tdied,\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\n    looked upon an angel.\n\n    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\n    gender.  When\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\n    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:\n\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\n    attract the public\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\n    quietude and peace.\n\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\twas  beaming  in  the\n    morning sun:\n\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\n    hardest\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\ttouch\n    it\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\n    Then pointing to a rose he said:\n\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\n    of\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\n    as\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\twan,  and  go\n    before their time to the grave.\"\n\n\n\n\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\n    of\tthe garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\n    blossomed  earlier\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\n    and said:\n\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\n    of\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\n    flowers!\n\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\n    once  more\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\n    become  brown  and\tyellow\tand  when  the\tsun came forth in its\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\n\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\n    an\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\traised\tin  my\theart\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\n    should\n\n\t\t\t\t   -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\n\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\n    mind that she never forgot them.\n\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and\twise,  and  amid  the\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring\tas  a\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\n\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\n    fruits  of\this  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\n    pious teaching and example.\n\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together\tin  a\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\n\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\n    to\tthe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the\tsame  way  my\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\n    cannot be separated\n\n\n\n\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\n    of the presence of God\n\n-- \nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \nViva Cristo Rey !!

Ipser, Jr., 1993\n>\n\nHere's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list\n\n\n10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\n\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\n     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about \n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\n\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\n     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\n     share!\n\n7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\n     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!\n\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!\n\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then\n     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\n\n4.   Make love, not War!\n\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.\n\n2.   See number 10.\n\n1.

When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I\nreceived a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for\nthe poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were\nsuppose to).\n\nVibration?

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.\n\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\nbe it."}, {"Newsgroup": "rec.motorcycles", "document_id": "608", "content": "kevin.l.stell (kstell@cbnewsl.cb.att.com) wrote:\n\n: [...

I don't feel compelled to\ndiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \n\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\nme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.

I\n   >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.\n\n       If you are questioning whether or not \"hating sin\" is consistent with\n   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:\n\n       Romans 12:9 \"Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling\n                    to what is good.\"\n\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\n\n   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\n   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\n   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\n   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\n   >hate the sinner.\n\n       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\n\n   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\n   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\n   >what they are doing is a sin).\n\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\n\n   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't\n   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\n   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\n   >love.\n\n       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\n   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and\n   they will have rejected it.\n\n       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we\n   will, ourselves, be in sin.\n\n   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our\n   >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate.\n\n       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New\n   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.\n\n   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.\n\n       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.\n\n   Hope this helps,\n   In Christ,\n   Tony Balsamo\n--\n\n            +--------------------------------------------------+\n            |   Name: Antonio L.

That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.

As a supernatural being, \nGod's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence \nof a physical, natural cosmos does.

Yes, what they wanted was \nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\n\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not \nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If \nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' \nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\n\n>>\"...

My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn't really important, unless you are \ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm \nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\n\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this \ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \nthe two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \nunion, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men.\n\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the \nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn't Caligula \nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \nwife.\n\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I \nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \nmy reply.)\n\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \nother sins) are really wrong:\n\n>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\n>activity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n>\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.

Perhaps the \nreason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \nI'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \nwanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new \nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \npracticing homosexuality!\n\n>Homosexual behavior is no different.

How do \nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \nthe person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive \nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's \ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \nobsessive.\n\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define \"perverted\" \nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.

Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \nwould show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \nGod's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\n\nI've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\n\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why:\n\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?  \nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\n\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \npeople.\"\n\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to \ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \nsex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\n\n>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\n>be \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\n>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\n>determine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.\n\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \nconclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\n\n(continued in Part 2)\n\n- Mark"}, {"Newsgroup": "talk.politics.misc", "document_id": "636", "content": "muellerm@vuse.vanderbilt.edu (Marc Mueller) writes:\n>fpa1@Trumpet.CC.MsState.Edu (Fletcher P Adams) writes:\n>>>\n>>>Eliminate the C-17 transport. \n>>\n>>Wrong.
